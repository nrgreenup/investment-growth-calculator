# investment-growth-calculator
An investment growth calculator that allows variability by tax treatment, interest rates, and inflation (and eventually, probably others as well).

Most investment calculators allow for single-cycle investments... "If I contribute $100 a month for the next 10 years, and I start with $1,000, how much will I have at the end?". The problem is that's not how people save or invest. 401(k) contributions are based on pay cycles, bonuses are paid annually, every now and then you check your bank account and decide to move a little bit into savings. Expected returns aren't the same either, as investment strategies vary based on account type (e.g., one might be more aggressive in a retirement account with a longer horzion until withdrawal).

This app, which is very much a work in progress, is intended to solve my frustration with the lack of existing tooling to allow for these sorts of projections.
